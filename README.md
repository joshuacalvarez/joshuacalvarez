# Hi! I'm Joshua Alvarez! 🧑‍💻
I'm a software development student at Grand Canyon University that is passionate about anything creative tech. From video games, interactive art, and creation-based projects, I love working on and seeing the creations come to life!

## What I've been Working On
- 🎮📝 AnaGrow: A Unity-based mobile word puzzle game
- 🎮🐟 Fission Chips: A 2D infinite runner game that's fish themed
- 🎓💧 Dancing Water Fountain (My Senior Project): An Aruduino-controlled fountain that synchronizes lights and water with music


## Beyond Coding
When I'm not programming, I'm usually drawing, digitally painting, or making some music. Just anything to get my creativity pumping.
